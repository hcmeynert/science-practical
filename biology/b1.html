	<h1>Biology B.1: Measuring the Size of a Cell Nucleus</h1>
	<br><br>
	<div style=" text-align: left">
	<text><i>Prerequisites:</i> I used in this an old student's
	microscope with limited quality, microscope slides of glass, onion
	cells, and a ruler.

	The "diameter" \(d\) of the cellular nuclei hereby pertains
	to the blueish and greenish parts to be seen in the picture,
	which are surrounded by even larger parts that don't belong to the
	nucleus itself.
	<br>
	If we multiply the ratio of the pixels of the nucleus
	and the resolution of the long side of the picure,
	multiplying by 480 \(\mu \)m, and collecting the
	errors according to <a href="../theory/t1.html">Theorem T.1</a>,
	we get
	
	$$ d = (5.87 \pm 0.74) \mu\text{m}$$
	
	This exactly coincides with the literature value to be found on
	various places on the internet.
	<br>
	Now, we are in a position to do a fascinating estimation.
	We estimate a priori the information content of an onion.
	A simple 1 MB picture of an onion has \(10^7\) bit. This
	is the absolute minimum. If you take a 1000 year long mp4 of
	the growing of the plant, which is about \(10^7\) GB
	or \(10^{17}\) bit, it will exceed the information content
	of the onion. So, we have for the number \(G\) of genes
	
	$$ 10^7 < G < 10^{17} $$
	
	So you get for the diameter \(d_G\) of a genome of 1 bit
	
	$$ 10^8 > d_G > 10^{-11} $$
	
	(if you calculate in cubes of \(d\) and \(d_G\)).
	If you now set forth, that a genome consist of, rougly estimated,
	10 atoms in diameter, you get the diameter \(d_a\) of an atom as
	
	$$ 10^{-9} > d_a > 10^{-12} $$
