	<h1>Physics P.1: Measuring Solar Second</h1><br><br>
	<div style=" text-align: left">
	<text><i>Prerequisites:</i> I used in this a pendulum wall clock,
	a marker for the shadow of the sun on a sunny balcony,
	and a tape measure to measure the length of the pendulum
	<br><br>
	<b>1.</b> The pendulum clock does 48:00:00 h &plusmn; 00:10:00 h
	in exactly two solar days (as verified with the marker for the
	shadow of the sun on my sunny balcony). This calculates to
	an error of 0.35 %. Therefore, we get a number of hours
	
	$$ h_c = 24.0 \pm 0.35 \% $$
	
	<br><br>
	<b>2.</b> My pendulum clock does 500 &plusmn; 10 oscillations in
	ten minutes according to my counting. Therefore, it certainly
	exactly does
	
	$$ N_h = 3000 $$
	
	oscillations per hour. For, in the measured realm of
	3000 &plusmn; 60 oscillations, the number 3000 is most prominent,
	and the clockmaker will certainly have chosen it. It can
	easily be achieved by gears. Furthermore, it can be divided
	by 12 (5 minutes) and by 60 (one minute).
	<br><br>
	<b>3.</b> The length of the pendulum of my clock is

	$$ l_p = (0.358 \pm 0.0037) \text{ m} $$

	This follows, if I measure its three parts, add them 
	and calculate the error using <a href="../theory/t1.html">
	Theorem T.1</a>.
	<br><br>
	<b>4.</b> The length \(l_s\) of a pendulum with a period equal to
	one solar second or \(\frac{1}{86400}\) of a solar day can now be
	found as
	
	$$ l_s = (0.24861 \pm 0.00303) \text{ m} $$

	This follows at once, if you manipulate the well-known formula for
	the period \(T\) of a pendulum with length \(l\)

	$$ T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}} $$
	
	to get
	
	$$ l_s = l_p\cdot\left(\frac{N_h\cdot h_c}{86400}\right)^2 $$
	
	Using <a href="../theory/t1.html">Theorem T.1</a> and the values
	for \(l_p\), \(N_h\) and \(h_c\) found before
	gives the error. This is what was to be found.
