	<h1>Physics P.3: Measuring the angular Distance between the Sun
	and a halved Moon</h1>
	<br><br>
	<div style=" text-align: left">
	<text><i>Prerequisites:</i> At night, I put a bottle into the light
	coming from a halved Moon and measured the length of its shadow.
	I also record the exact time and date, the distance of the Moon from
	the southern direction and the latitude of my location.

	The law of cosines in spherical trigonometry reads,
	according to the above diagram
	
	$$ \cos x = \cos (s)\cdot \cos (n) + \sin (s)\cdot \sin (n)\cdot\cos (\xi ) $$
	
	gives \(x\). The law of sines, in the very same spherical
	geometry, now reads
	
	$$ \frac{\sin x}{\sin \xi } = \frac{\sin n}{\sin \nu }$$
	
	to furnish \(\nu\). Now, we can calculate from the table,
	
	$$ (\delta +\nu )- \nu  = \delta $$
	
	We plainly calculate the approximate height \(\varrho _S\) of the
	Sun above the celestial equator by
	
	$$ \sin \varrho _S = \sin (\vartheta )\cdot\sin (\varepsilon ) $$
	
	where \(\varepsilon = 23,5^o\) is the ecliptic angle. 
	
	We get
	
	$$ z = \frac{\pi }{2}- \varrho _S $$
	
	We now are in a position to derive the angle finally sought for,
	that is, \(d\), by applying the law of cosines in spherical
	tringonometry again, namely
	
	$$ \cos d = \cos (z)\cdot \cos (x) + \sin (z)\cdot \sin (x)\cdot\cos (\delta ) $$
	
	The following table collects all values obtained in course of calculation:
	<br><br>

		<table border="solid">
		<tr>
			<td>definition</td>
			<td>symbol</td>
			<td>calculated value</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>distance of the Moon from the north pole at that time</td>
			<td>\(x\)</td>
			<td>\(60.77810^o\)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>angle of Moon-North-Zenith at north pole</td>
			<td>\(\nu \)</td>
			<td>\(53.15338^o\)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>angle of Sun-North-Moon at north pole</td>
			<td>\(\delta \)</td>
			<td>\(88.84661^o\)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>angle between Sun and north pole</td>
			<td>\(z\)</td>
			<td>\(95.92369^o\)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>distance of the Sun and a halved Moon</td>
			<td>\(d \)</td>
			<td>\(91.88593^o\)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="3">uncertainty = \(\pm 5^o\)</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
	</center>
	<br><br>
	So, from the uncertainty of \(\pm 5^o\) (which is estimated
	because the halved Moon is not exactly halved, as well as
	because the distance of the Sun from equinox is approximated,
	and because the other errors add up), we can
	say with these values
	
	$$ d > 87^o $$
	
	and, therefore,
	
	$$ \frac{d_S}{d_M} = \frac{1}{\cos d} > 20 $$
	
	(\(d_S, d_M\) distances of Sun and Moon from Earth) So, our result reads:
	<br><br>
	<i>The Sun is more than 20 times more distant from Earth than the Moon is.</i>
